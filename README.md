# Building Deep Learning Neural Networks in Keras -- One Lego Block at a Time

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we'll use **Keras** to build deep learning neural network models from scratch -- layer by layer, block by block. **Python + deep learning -- like Legos for your brain**. We'll walk through the process of building, tuning, and understanding neural networks from setting up the simplest architecture to experimenting with hyperparameters and visualizing learning.

In the process, weâ€™ll see not just what works, but why (and what breaks along the way). Think of it as a beginner-friendly blueprint for deep learning -- a peek under the hood. In the end, we'll build a neural network with nearly **2 million trainable parameters** and explore an intuitive and powerful deep learning technique called **Dropout**.
